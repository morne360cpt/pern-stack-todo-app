# pern-todo-app

In this PERN Todo Application I have created a Todo List which demonstrates how a Restful API, uses transfer protocol in order to run CRUD operations.

A Restful API takes in the HTTP request and instructs the Database what CRUD operation to perform.

In order to run the PERN Todo Application in your web browser, you need to start both the server and the client in the terminal.

## To start the server run

Navigate to the server folder and run `nodemon index`

## To start the client run

Navigate to the client folder and run `npm start`
